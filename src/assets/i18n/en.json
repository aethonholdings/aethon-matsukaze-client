A half-blood, the son to a Syrian emir and a Byzantine noblewoman, Vassilios shows very little promise at a time when manhood is defined by the sheer ability to survive in a world full of violence: strength and skill in arms. </p><p>Yet, through a harrowing, mystical journey to the ends of the world and an internal battle between good and evil, Vassilios will defeat his greatest fears to transform into Digenes, an unstoppable warrior, and become leader of the Akrites, Byzantium’s celebrated border guards.</p>"

A few semesters and a degree later they decided it’d be better to just follow their dream and do what they always wanted to do instead and just draw. That’s how they landed their first participation in IDW’s team project Womanthology: Heroic. It was enough to make them fall in love with the art of making comics and they never looked back. Since then they’ve worked with people all over the world as a freelance illustrator and comic artist and their first personal graphic novel as an artist (with writer Paul Mallory), “Greta’s Grimoire, Book1: Initiations” was published in Greece by Jemma Press, followed by “Bestiary”. They’re currently working as a writer and artist on a love project “Equidistance”, a queer, multidimensional mystery/action story alongside co-writer and co-artist Dennis Yatras."

He is a graduate of both Athens School of Graphic Arts in PA.D.A. as well as Middlesex University’s Fashion Design course. In 2017 he decided to follow his desire to complete Dark Practice, a spooky comic about a team of teenage witches. The first issue of his passion project made its debut on Comicdom CON Athens 2018. From then on he attended many other conventions in Greece and Europe. In 2019 he started to write and illustrate the graphic novel “Equidistance” along with his long-time friend Avgo. The four-parts of this new work are going to be published by Nerdula Creative Lab starting from the last quarter of 2021."

        "title": "The epic of Digenes",
        "narrative": "<p>From the depths of the European Middle Ages and across the continent, springs a series of epic oral traditions: the Arthurian legends, Beowulf, the Icelandic Sagas, Tristan and Iseult.  Stories that are transmitted from mouth to mouth, they are likely centred on historical people and, with the passage of time, transform into fingerprints of the lives and values of the people that retold them.  Awash in metaphysics, religion and magic, they celebrate their protagonists’ martial skills and romantic love.  They describe the superhuman achievements of characters that, today, we would call superheroes.</p><p>With the passage of centuries, the real people behind these stories slowly disappear.  The only thing left is a kernel of truth, surrounded by the collective dream.</p><p>The Byzantine epic of the Two-Blood Border Lord (Digenes Akritas, in Greek), is one of these works. It is not a single, concrete text, but a corpus of oral traditions and Medieval manuscripts that describe the life and adventures of a man who lives and fights on the Eastern border of the empire, son of a Saracen Emir, who converts to Christianity, and a Roman (Byzantine) noblewoman. The stories are recorded for the first time in the beginning of the second millennium, at dates that are hotly debated, in six manuscripts that still survive: Escorial, Trebizond, Andros-Athens, Grottaferrata, Oxford, and Andros. In parallel with the recorded versions, the myth of Digenes continues to evolve in folk songs across the Greek-speaking world, especially in Asia Minor, Crete and Cyprus.</p><p>In the manuscripts, the stories are largely recorded in poems.  Written in coarse language, with frequent spelling errors, they are clearly popular, not scholarly works.  Their disregard for historical accuracy and their inconsistencies are such that it is impossible to place the stories in a clear historical era: some report a meeting between Digenes and a Byzantine emperor called Basil, while researchers place other versions as set during the reign of Romanos I.</p>The manuscripts and songs express admiration for Digenes' martial skills, beauty and his Christian faith, with minimal references to allegiance to a country or nation.  They are full of fantastic feats: hunting triumphs, battles with bandits, dragons, Amazons and death himself, passionate and often violent love.  They are the pop culture of their era.</p><p>This rich corpus of tradition underpins the graphic novel Digenes.  The book springs from a simple  question: who might the real person behind the superhero have been?  And, following that: what were his true achievements and struggles, and why did they leave such a lively impression in the imagination of his contemporaries?</p>"
