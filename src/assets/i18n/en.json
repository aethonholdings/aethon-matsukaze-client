A few semesters and a degree later they decided it’d be better to just follow their dream and do what they always wanted to do instead and just draw. That’s how they landed their first participation in IDW’s team project Womanthology: Heroic. It was enough to make them fall in love with the art of making comics and they never looked back. Since then they’ve worked with people all over the world as a freelance illustrator and comic artist and their first personal graphic novel as an artist (with writer Paul Mallory), “Greta’s Grimoire, Book1: Initiations” was published in Greece by Jemma Press, followed by “Bestiary”. They’re currently working as a writer and artist on a love project “Equidistance”, a queer, multidimensional mystery/action story alongside co-writer and co-artist Dennis Yatras."

In 2017 he decided to follow his desire to complete Dark Practice, a spooky comic about a team of teenage witches. The first issue of his passion project made its debut on Comicdom CON Athens 2018. From then on he attended many other conventions in Greece and Europe. In 2019 he started to write and illustrate the graphic novel “Equidistance” along with his long-time friend Avgo. The four-parts of this new work are going to be published by Nerdula Creative Lab starting from the last quarter of 2021."

        "title": "The epic of Digenes",
        "narrative": "<p>From the depths of the European Middle Ages and across the continent, springs a series of epic oral traditions: the Arthurian legends, Beowulf, the Icelandic Sagas, Tristan and Iseult.  Stories that are transmitted from mouth to mouth, they are likely centred on historical people and, with the passage of time, transform into fingerprints of the lives and values of the people that retold them.  Awash in metaphysics, religion and magic, they celebrate their protagonists’ martial skills and romantic love.  They describe the superhuman achievements of characters that, today, we would call superheroes.</p><p>With the passage of centuries, the real people behind these stories slowly disappear.  The only thing left is a kernel of truth, surrounded by the collective dream.</p><p>The Byzantine epic of the Two-Blood Border Lord (Digenes Akritas, in Greek), is one of these works. It is not a single, concrete text, but a corpus of oral traditions and Medieval manuscripts that describe the life and adventures of a man who lives and fights on the Eastern border of the empire, son of a Saracen Emir, who converts to Christianity, and a Roman (Byzantine) noblewoman. The stories are recorded for the first time in the beginning of the second millennium, at dates that are hotly debated, in six manuscripts that still survive: Escorial, Trebizond, Andros-Athens, Grottaferrata, Oxford, and Andros. In parallel with the recorded versions, the myth of Digenes continues to evolve in folk songs across the Greek-speaking world, especially in Asia Minor, Crete and Cyprus.</p><p>In the manuscripts, the stories are largely recorded in poems.  Written in coarse language, with frequent spelling errors, they are clearly popular, not scholarly works.  Their disregard for historical accuracy and their inconsistencies are such that it is impossible to place the stories in a clear historical era: some report a meeting between Digenes and a Byzantine emperor called Basil, while researchers place other versions as set during the reign of Romanos I.</p>The manuscripts and songs express admiration for Digenes' martial skills, beauty and his Christian faith, with minimal references to allegiance to a country or nation.  They are full of fantastic feats: hunting triumphs, battles with bandits, dragons, Amazons and death himself, passionate and often violent love.  They are the pop culture of their era.</p><p>This rich corpus of tradition underpins the graphic novel Digenes.  The book springs from a simple  question: who might the real person behind the superhero have been?  And, following that: what were his true achievements and struggles, and why did they leave such a lively impression in the imagination of his contemporaries?</p>"

          "section1": "<p>The two-headed eagle is a charged symbol.  Today, it still features on many national flags, including those of Albania, Serbia, and Montenegro.  It’s also on the flag of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, regarded as \"first among equals\" of the Orthodox Christian churches, the Russian Ministry of Defence and even football teams.  In many of the countries where it is still in use, it is often connected with extreme, nationalistic tendencies.  It is a powder keg of emotions.</p><p>But what is the actual meaning of this symbol?</p><p>Its first well-known use in the West is as the crest of the Byzantine empire.  The two-headed eagle first appears in Byzantine art in the 9th century, not as a crest but, rather, as a decorative pattern.  It is only towards the end of Byzantine history, after the 12th century, that it begins to feature on the crest of the Paleologos family, the last imperial dynasty, as well as those of other aristocratic houses.</p>",
          "section2": "<p>We do not know why the two-headed eagle became popular among the Byzantines.  In stark contrast to Western heraldry, which follows very set rules to this day, for most of Byzantine history, each nobleman chose a motif of their personal preference.  Byzantine crests usually had religious motifs and often served as calls to God for victory on the battlefield.</p><p>But the two-headed eagle has no relationship to Christianity, raising the question of what it meant in Byzantium.  The main interpretation is that the eagle refers to the roots the empire in Classical Rome, and that the two heads represent its might across West and East.</p><p>It is less well-known that, well before it was used in Byzantium, the symbol appears across the history of the whole of Eurasia, all the way to prehistoric times.  For example, to the East of Byzantium, in the 11th century, before the rise of the Paleologos dynasty, the two-headed eagle was used on the standards of the Sunni Muslim empire of the Seljuks, a Turkic people with origins in the depths of Central Asia.</p>",
          "section3": "<p>In fact, the first depictions of two headed eagle that we know of are incredibly ancient.  The symbol appers in the ruins of Alaca Höyük, a Hittite Bronze Age settlement, and, before that on Mesopotamian seals. Alaca Höyük itself has a Neolithic substratum.</p>",
          "section4": "<p>The suggestion that the symbol might have been in use during even prehistoric times has led some academics to pursue it in a broader, anthropologic context.  The roots of the Seljuk Turks, in the vast expanse of the Central Asian steppe, suggest we can look for the symbol in ancient, oral traditions across this huge area.<p><p>In the myths of the Yakut, a Turkic people of West Siberia, we come across the image of a multitude of bird-gods sitting on the branches of the World Tree. On the top of this tree, we find Toyon Kottor, a “Lord Creator”, the master of birds: a two-headed eagle. Toyon Kottor is often depicted on the clothes and drums of shamans, human channels between the supernatural and the natural, who, in holy ecstasy, connect with the world of the divine.</p><p>There, on the boundary of history and myth, reality and dream, conscious and subconscious, the only tool that we have to understand the primal meaning of this symbol is speculation through a primordial, poetic lens.</p>",
          "section5": "<p>How does such a strange image emerge in the mind of an animist hunter?  Perhaps through the mating of two birds, male and female, the union of subjective opposites, into One, the essence of reality that the shamans experience at the height of their ecstasy.  There, where opposites reveal themselves as two sides of the same coin.</p><p>That’s how the two-headed eagle is used in Digenes: an ancient, magical symbol of divine union, like the Yin and Yang.  And, here, we return to the question: who, and how, introduced the symbol to Byzantine semiotics?  What events and stories around this person moved the Romans so much to slowly embrace it as a representation of their identity?</p>"
